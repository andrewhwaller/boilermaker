Usage in Views:
    # Single file upload
    render Components::FileUpload.new(
      name: "user[avatar]",
      accept: "image/*"
    )

    # Multiple file upload
    render Components::FileUpload.new(

    )

    # File preview
    render Components::FilePreview.new(

    )

    # File list with actions
    render Components::FileList.new(
      attachments: @user.documents,
      deletable: true,
      delete_path: ->(a) { document_path(a) }
    )

Production Setup:
    Configure cloud storage in config/storage.yml:

    amazon:
      service: S3
      access_key_id: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:aws, :access_key_id) %>
      secret_access_key: <%= Rails.application.credentials.dig(:aws, :secret_access_key) %>
      region: us-east-1
      bucket: your-bucket

    Then update config/environments/production.rb:
      config.active_storage.service = :amazon

## Description

Implement plan-based access control throughout the application. Create a comprehensive system for checking feature access based on user's current plan, with proper error handling and user messaging when limits are exceeded.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] FeatureAccess service class with methods: can_access?, usage_remaining?, at_limit?
- [ ] Controller concern for feature access checks
- [ ] Middleware to enforce feature limits on API endpoints
- [ ] Helper methods for view-level feature gating
- [ ] Usage tracking for countable features (API calls, projects, users)
- [ ] Graceful error handling with upgrade prompts
- [ ] Feature access caching for performance
- [ ] Background job to sync feature flags with Flipper

## Technical Notes

- Use Rails concerns for controller integration
- Implement caching strategy (Redis) for frequently checked features
- Create custom exceptions for feature access violations
- Consider rate limiting integration for API features
- Use decorators or presenters for upgrade messaging

## Definition of Done

- Feature access works across all application areas
- Performance impact is minimal (sub 10ms overhead)
- Error messages guide users to appropriate upgrade paths
- All edge cases are handled (expired plans, no plan, etc.)
- Feature usage is accurately tracked
- Tests cover all access scenarios

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: High**
- Performance impact on every request
- Complex integration points throughout app
- Risk of blocking legitimate users

## Notes

Critical system that affects entire application. Must be performant and reliable.

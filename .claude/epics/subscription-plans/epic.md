# Epic: Subscription Plan Management

## Overview

Implement comprehensive subscription plan management system with tiered service offerings, feature-based access control, and integrated billing. The system will enable SaaS business models with different service tiers, automated plan changes with prorated billing, and administrative tools for managing plans and features.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Feature Flagging**: Use Flipper gem v0.28.1 for granular feature access control across plan tiers
- **Plan Management**: Database-driven plan configuration with Stripe integration for billing
- **Access Control**: Plan-based feature checking throughout application with fail-secure defaults
- **Billing Integration**: Seamless integration with Stripe for plan changes and prorated billing
- **Admin Interface**: Comprehensive admin tools for plan and feature management

## Technical Approach

### Plan Management System
Build flexible plan configuration:
- Plan model with configurable features, pricing, limits, and billing cycles
- Feature flag integration for granular access control across application
- Plan hierarchy with logical upgrade/downgrade paths
- Usage tracking and limit enforcement with configurable overage handling

### Customer Plan Experience
Create user-friendly plan management:
- Plan comparison interface showing features and pricing for each tier
- User dashboard with current plan status and usage statistics
- Plan change workflows with billing preview and confirmation
- Automated plan renewal and expiration handling

### Feature Access Control
Implement comprehensive access control:
- Plan-based feature checking in controllers and views
- Programmatic feature availability APIs
- Usage limit enforcement with graceful degradation
- Override capabilities for admin and support scenarios

### Administrative Interface
Build powerful admin tools:
- Plan creation and modification interface
- Feature flag management with testing capabilities
- Customer plan management for support scenarios
- Analytics and reporting for plan usage and conversion

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Data Models**: Create Plan, UserPlan, and feature flag integration models
2. **Feature Access**: Implement plan-based access control throughout application
3. **Plan Interface**: Build customer-facing plan comparison and selection
4. **Plan Changes**: Implement plan change workflows with Stripe billing integration
5. **Admin Tools**: Create administrative interface for plan and feature management
6. **Usage Tracking**: Implement usage monitoring and limit enforcement
7. **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive testing with Stripe billing system

### Access Control Strategy
- Feature checking service with caching for performance
- Plan-based middleware for controller access control
- View helpers for plan-based UI rendering
- API endpoints for programmatic feature checking

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Plan Data Models**: Create Plan and UserPlan models with Flipper integration
- [ ] **Feature Access System**: Implement plan-based access control throughout application
- [ ] **Plan Selection Interface**: Build customer plan comparison and selection UI
- [ ] **Plan Change Workflows**: Implement plan upgrades/downgrades with prorated billing
- [ ] **Administrative Tools**: Create admin interface for plan and feature management
- [ ] **Usage Tracking**: Implement usage monitoring and limit enforcement system

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Completed Stripe integration (Task 5) for billing and payment processing
- Existing User authentication and authorization system
- Admin dashboard framework for plan management interface
- Background job processing system for plan change handling

### External Dependencies
- Flipper gem v0.28.1 for feature flag management
- Stripe API for pricing and subscription management
- Redis or database backend for Flipper feature flag storage
- Existing database infrastructure for plan data storage

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Plan Management Performance
- Feature access checks complete within 50ms for 99% of requests
- Plan change processing handles concurrent requests safely
- Database queries optimized for plan and feature lookups
- Feature flag system scales efficiently with user base growth

### Business Integration Success
- Plan conversion and upgrade rates tracked accurately
- Billing integration maintains data consistency with Stripe
- Admin interface enables non-technical plan management
- Usage limit enforcement prevents service abuse while maintaining user experience

### System Reliability
- Plan changes are atomic with proper rollback capabilities
- Feature access fails securely (deny by default) when system unavailable
- Usage tracking maintains accuracy under concurrent load
- All plan-related operations covered by comprehensive tests

## Description

Implement comprehensive plan upgrade and downgrade workflows with prorated billing, proper state management, and edge case handling. Include immediate upgrades, end-of-period downgrades, and cancellation flows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Upgrade workflow with immediate access and prorated billing
- [ ] Downgrade workflow scheduled for end of billing period
- [ ] Cancellation workflow with end-of-period access
- [ ] Plan change preview showing cost adjustments
- [ ] Email notifications for all plan changes
- [ ] Webhook handlers for Stripe subscription events
- [ ] Rollback capability for failed plan changes
- [ ] Grace period handling for payment failures

## Technical Notes

- Use Stripe subscription modification APIs
- Implement state machine for plan transition states
- Create background jobs for async plan changes
- Handle webhook retries and idempotency
- Store plan change history for auditing

## Definition of Done

- All plan change scenarios work correctly
- Billing calculations are accurate
- Users receive appropriate notifications
- Failed changes are properly handled and logged
- Edge cases (expired cards, etc.) are managed
- Stripe webhooks are processed reliably

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: High**
- Billing accuracy is critical
- Complex state management
- Integration points with external service
- Financial impact of bugs

## Notes

Most complex part of subscription system. Requires thorough testing and careful error handling.

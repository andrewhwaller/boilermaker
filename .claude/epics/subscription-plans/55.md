## Description

Implement comprehensive usage monitoring and limit enforcement system. Track feature usage across different metrics (API calls, storage, users, projects) and provide real-time feedback to users about their consumption relative to plan limits.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Usage tracking service with increment/decrement methods
- [ ] Real-time usage counters with Redis backing
- [ ] Daily/monthly usage aggregation and reporting
- [ ] Usage alerts when approaching plan limits
- [ ] Automatic feature disable when limits exceeded
- [ ] Usage dashboard for end users
- [ ] Historical usage trends and analytics
- [ ] Background jobs for usage data cleanup and archiving

## Technical Notes

- Use Redis for real-time counters with fallback to database
- Implement sliding window counters for rate-limited features
- Create usage events for audit trail
- Use background jobs for heavy aggregation work
- Consider data retention policies for historical usage

## Definition of Done

- Usage tracking is accurate and performant
- Users receive timely notifications about usage
- Limits are enforced consistently
- Historical data is preserved appropriately
- Dashboard provides actionable usage insights
- System handles high-volume tracking efficiently

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: Medium**
- High-volume write operations impact performance
- Data accuracy crucial for billing
- Storage requirements for historical data

## Notes

Critical for plan enforcement and user experience. Must be highly performant and reliable.

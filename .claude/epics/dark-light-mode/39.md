# Task: System Integration

## Description
Implement automatic theme preference detection and localStorage persistence system. This includes detecting the user's system preference, managing theme state across browser sessions, and providing a robust JavaScript API for theme management throughout the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement system preference detection (`prefers-color-scheme`)
- [ ] Create localStorage persistence for user theme choice
- [ ] Build JavaScript theme manager with clean API
- [ ] Implement theme initialization on page load
- [ ] Handle preference changes and system updates
- [ ] Create theme state management for SPA-like interactions
- [ ] Add proper error handling for localStorage issues
- [ ] Ensure theme persistence across browser sessions

## Technical Details
- Detect `prefers-color-scheme: dark` media query on first visit
- Store user explicit choice in localStorage as `theme-preference`
- Priority order: user choice > system preference > default (light)
- Use `ThemeManager` class with methods: `getTheme()`, `setTheme()`, `toggleTheme()`
- Listen for system preference changes with `matchMedia`
- Implement theme change event system for component updates
- Handle localStorage quota exceeded and disabled scenarios gracefully

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Theme Infrastructure Setup)
- [ ] Understanding of current JavaScript architecture
- [ ] Browser compatibility requirements

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on theme infrastructure)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Automatic system preference detection working
- [ ] localStorage persistence implemented and tested
- [ ] Theme manager JavaScript API complete
- [ ] Theme state survives page reloads
- [ ] System preference changes are handled dynamically
- [ ] Error handling for storage issues implemented
- [ ] Clean JavaScript API documented and tested

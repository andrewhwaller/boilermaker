# Task: Theme Infrastructure Setup

## Description
Configure Tailwind CSS dark mode functionality and create the foundational theme management system. This includes setting up the CSS custom properties, configuring Tailwind's dark mode strategy, and creating the core theme utilities that will power the entire dark/light mode system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS dark mode in tailwind.config.js (class strategy)
- [ ] Create CSS custom properties for theme colors in application.css
- [ ] Set up semantic color tokens (primary, secondary, background, text, etc.)
- [ ] Create theme utility classes for common patterns
- [ ] Define consistent color palette for both light and dark themes
- [ ] Configure proper color contrast ratios for accessibility
- [ ] Update existing color usage to use semantic tokens
- [ ] Test theme switching at CSS level

## Technical Details
- Use Tailwind's class-based dark mode strategy (`darkMode: 'class'`)
- Define CSS custom properties for all theme-aware colors
- Create semantic color system: background, surface, primary, secondary, accent, text variants
- Ensure proper contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Use HSL color format for better programmatic manipulation
- Create utility classes for common theme patterns (borders, shadows, etc.)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Current Tailwind CSS configuration review
- [ ] Existing color usage audit in Phlex components
- [ ] Accessibility requirements analysis

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: true (foundational work)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Tailwind dark mode configured and working
- [ ] Complete set of CSS custom properties defined
- [ ] Semantic color system implemented
- [ ] Existing colors migrated to new system
- [ ] Theme switching works at CSS level
- [ ] All color combinations meet WCAG contrast requirements
- [ ] Documentation for color system created

# Task: Toggle Interface Implementation

## Description
Create an intuitive and accessible theme switching interface with multiple interaction methods. This includes designing a toggle component, implementing keyboard shortcuts, providing visual feedback, and integrating the toggle into the main application navigation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design and implement theme toggle component (button/switch)
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcut support (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + L)
- [ ] Integrate toggle into main navigation/header
- [ ] Implement smooth visual transitions between themes
- [ ] Add loading/transition states during theme switch
- [ ] Create mobile-friendly toggle interface
- [ ] Add visual indicators for current theme state
- [ ] Implement proper ARIA attributes for screen readers

## Technical Details
- Create `ThemeToggle` Phlex component with icon and text options
- Use system icons (sun/moon) or custom SVG icons for theme indication
- Implement CSS transitions for smooth theme switching (200-300ms)
- Add keyboard event listener for Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + L shortcut
- Provide feedback during theme transition (loading state, animation)
- Position toggle appropriately in header/navigation without disrupting layout
- Handle both click and keyboard interactions
- Add proper focus management and outline styles

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Theme Infrastructure) - needed for theme system
- [ ] Task 002 (System Integration) - needed for theme manager API

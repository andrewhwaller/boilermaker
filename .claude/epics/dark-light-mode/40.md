# Task: Component Dark Mode Implementation

## Description
Systematically add dark mode variants to all existing Phlex components. This involves auditing all components, updating them to use the semantic color system, and ensuring consistent dark mode behavior across the entire component library.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Audit all Phlex components for color usage
- [ ] Update components to use semantic color tokens
- [ ] Implement dark variants for all UI components
- [ ] Update form components with dark mode styles
- [ ] Add dark variants for navigation and layout components
- [ ] Ensure icons and graphics work in both themes
- [ ] Test all components in both light and dark modes
- [ ] Create component showcase for dark mode testing

## Technical Details
- Convert hardcoded colors to CSS custom properties and Tailwind semantic classes
- Focus on key components: buttons, forms, cards, modals, navigation, alerts
- Ensure consistent spacing and typography in dark mode
- Handle component state variations (hover, focus, active) in dark theme
- Address component-specific issues: shadows, borders, transparency
- Update any inline SVGs or CSS to be theme-aware
- Maintain visual hierarchy and emphasis in dark mode

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Theme Infrastructure Setup) - needed for semantic color system
- [ ] Complete list of all Phlex components in the project
- [ ] Component interaction patterns documentation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 10-12 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside system integration)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All components audited and documented
- [ ] Every component supports dark mode properly
- [ ] No hardcoded colors remain in components
- [ ] Component states (hover, focus, etc.) work in dark mode
- [ ] Visual consistency maintained across all components
- [ ] Component showcase demonstrates dark mode functionality
- [ ] All components tested in both light and dark themes

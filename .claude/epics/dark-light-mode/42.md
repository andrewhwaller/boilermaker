# Task: Accessibility Compliance

## Description
Ensure the dark/light mode implementation fully complies with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards. This includes comprehensive testing of color contrast ratios, screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and implementing proper accessibility features for the theme switching functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Verify all color combinations meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements
- [ ] Test screen reader compatibility with theme switching
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation works properly in both themes
- [ ] Implement proper focus indicators for both themes
- [ ] Add ARIA labels and descriptions for theme controls
- [ ] Test with multiple screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
- [ ] Verify reduced motion preferences are respected
- [ ] Create accessibility documentation for theme system

## Technical Details
- Use automated tools (axe-core, WAVE) and manual testing for contrast verification
- Minimum contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text, 3:1 for graphics
- Test with screen readers: announce theme changes, proper labeling
- Implement `prefers-reduced-motion` support for theme transitions
- Add comprehensive ARIA attributes: `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, `role`
- Ensure focus indicators are visible in both light and dark themes
- Test keyboard-only navigation through all theme-aware components
- Document accessibility features and testing procedures

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 (Theme Infrastructure) - color system needs validation
- [ ] Task 002 (System Integration) - theme manager needs accessibility features
- [ ] Task 003 (Component Implementation) - all components need accessibility testing
- [ ] Task 004 (Toggle Interface) - toggle needs full accessibility compliance
- [ ] Access to screen reader testing tools

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all previous tasks completed)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All color combinations verified to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- [ ] Screen reader testing completed and issues resolved
- [ ] Keyboard navigation fully functional in both themes
- [ ] Focus indicators properly visible in all theme states
- [ ] ARIA attributes properly implemented throughout
- [ ] Reduced motion preferences respected
- [ ] Accessibility documentation completed
- [ ] Automated accessibility tests passing

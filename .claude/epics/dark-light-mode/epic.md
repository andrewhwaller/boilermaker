# Epic: Dark/Light Mode Functionality

## Overview

Implement comprehensive theming system with automatic system preference detection, manual theme switching, and persistent user preferences. The system will provide seamless dark and light mode experiences with smooth transitions, accessibility compliance, and full component coverage across the application.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Theme Management**: Use class-based dark mode with Tailwind CSS (`darkMode: 'class'` configuration)
- **State Management**: Stimulus controller for theme detection, switching, and persistence
- **Storage Strategy**: localStorage for user preference persistence with system preference detection fallback
- **Styling Approach**: Tailwind `dark:` variants for all components with CSS custom properties for complex cases
- **Transition Strategy**: CSS transitions for smooth theme switching without layout shift

## Technical Approach

### Theme Detection and Management
Implement comprehensive theme system:
- Automatic system preference detection using `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- Manual theme toggle with visual state indication
- localStorage persistence with fallback to system preferences
- Theme initialization on page load without flash of unstyled content

### Component Styling
Enhance all existing Phlex components with dark mode support:
- Navigation and header components with appropriate dark variants
- Form elements and inputs with dark mode styling
- Buttons and interactive elements with dark/light variants  
- Data display components (tables, cards) with dark theme support
- Modal and overlay components with proper dark mode contrast

### User Interface Controls
Create intuitive theme switching interface:
- Theme toggle component in main navigation
- Keyboard shortcut support (Ctrl+Shift+T) for accessibility
- Visual feedback during theme transitions
- Clear indication of current theme state

### Integration Strategy
Ensure comprehensive theme coverage:
- All Phlex components support both themes
- Third-party component integration with dark mode
- Asset optimization (favicons, images) for both themes
- Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Tailwind Configuration**: Set up dark mode configuration and CSS custom properties
2. **Theme Controller**: Implement Stimulus controller for detection, switching, and persistence
3. **Component Enhancement**: Add dark mode variants to all existing components systematically
4. **UI Controls**: Create theme toggle component and keyboard shortcuts
5. **Integration Testing**: Ensure all components work seamlessly in both themes
6. **Accessibility Validation**: Test contrast ratios and screen reader compatibility

### Quality Assurance
- Visual testing in both light and dark modes
- Accessibility testing for color contrast compliance
- Performance testing to ensure smooth transitions
- Cross-browser testing for system preference detection

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Theme Infrastructure**: Configure Tailwind dark mode and create theme management system
- [ ] **System Integration**: Implement automatic preference detection and localStorage persistence
- [ ] **Component Dark Mode**: Add dark variants to all Phlex components systematically
- [ ] **Toggle Interface**: Create theme switching UI with keyboard shortcuts and visual feedback
- [ ] **Accessibility Compliance**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and screen reader support

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Completed Tailwind CSS setup (Task 1) ✅ for dark mode configuration
- Existing Phlex component library (Task 2) ✅ for theme variant implementation
- Responsive layout system (Task 3) for theme consistency across breakpoints

### External Dependencies
- Modern browser support for CSS custom properties and `prefers-color-scheme`
- Tailwind CSS dark mode utilities and configuration
- localStorage support for theme preference persistence

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Theme Functionality
- Automatic system preference detection works across all supported browsers
- Theme persistence maintains user choice across sessions with 100% reliability
- Theme switching response time under 300ms with smooth transitions
- All UI components fully functional in both light and dark themes

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast ratios maintained in both themes
- Screen reader announcements for theme changes
- Keyboard accessibility for all theme switching functions
- Support for users with `prefers-reduced-motion` settings

### User Experience Quality
- Zero visual bugs or inconsistencies in either theme
- No layout shift during theme transitions
- Theme toggle clearly indicates current state
- Consistent brand identity maintained across both themes

## Tasks Created
- [ ] #38 - Theme Infrastructure (parallel: true)
- [ ] #39 - System Integration (parallel: false)
- [ ] #40 - Component Dark Mode (parallel: true)
- [ ] #41 - Toggle Interface (parallel: false)
- [ ] #42 - Accessibility Compliance (parallel: false)

Total tasks: 5
Parallel tasks: 2
Sequential tasks: 3
Estimated total effort: 36-46 hours

## Estimated Effort

**Overall Timeline**: 1 week (as specified in original task)
**Resource Requirements**: 1 developer with Tailwind CSS and accessibility experience
**Critical Path Items**:
- Tailwind dark mode configuration and theme controller (1-2 days)
- Component dark mode implementation across all existing components (3-4 days)
- Theme toggle UI and keyboard shortcuts (1 day)
- Accessibility testing and contrast validation (1 day)

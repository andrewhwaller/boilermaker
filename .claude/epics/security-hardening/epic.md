# Epic: Security Hardening and Compliance

## Overview

Implement enterprise-grade security measures and compliance controls to protect against modern threats and meet regulatory requirements. This comprehensive security system will include automated vulnerability scanning, data encryption, audit trails, access controls, and incident response capabilities.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive CSP and security header implementation for web application protection
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated Brakeman v5.4.1 and bundle audit integration into CI/CD pipeline
- **Data Protection**: attr_encrypted gem v3.1.0 for sensitive data encryption at rest
- **Access Control**: IP restrictions, rate limiting, and enhanced authentication policies
- **Audit System**: Comprehensive audit trail for sensitive operations with compliance reporting

## Technical Approach

### Security Infrastructure
Implement foundational security measures:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers preventing XSS and injection attacks
- Complete security header suite (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- SSL/TLS hardening with proper certificate management
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection for API endpoints

### Automated Security Monitoring
Build continuous security assessment:
- Brakeman static code analysis integration into CI/CD pipeline
- Bundle audit for dependency vulnerability scanning
- Automated security scan reporting and failure handling
- Integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems

### Authentication and Access Security
Enhance user and admin security:
- Strong password policies with complexity requirements and breach checking
- Account lockout mechanisms and suspicious activity detection
- Two-factor authentication support for administrative accounts
- IP whitelisting for sensitive administrative operations

### Data Protection and Encryption
Implement comprehensive data security:
- Encryption at rest for sensitive user data and payment information
- Secure encryption key management and rotation procedures
- Data classification and protection policies
- Secure data deletion and retention compliance

### Audit and Compliance
Build enterprise-grade audit capabilities:
- Comprehensive audit trails for all sensitive operations
- Security event logging and real-time monitoring
- Compliance reporting for SOC 2, GDPR, and industry standards
- Incident response procedures and automated alerting

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Security Headers**: Implement CSP and comprehensive security header suite
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Integrate automated security scanning into development workflow
3. **Authentication Hardening**: Enhance password policies and implement access controls
4. **Data Encryption**: Implement encryption at rest for sensitive data
5. **Audit System**: Build comprehensive audit trail and logging system
6. **Monitoring Integration**: Connect security events to monitoring and alerting
7. **Compliance Documentation**: Create security policies and incident response procedures

### Security Testing Strategy
- OWASP ZAP integration for automated security testing
- Penetration testing procedures and regular security assessments
- Security regression testing for all code changes
- Compliance audit preparation and documentation

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Security Headers and CSP**: Implement comprehensive security headers and Content Security Policy
- [ ] **Automated Security Scanning**: Integrate Brakeman and bundle audit into CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] **Authentication Security**: Implement strong password policies and enhanced access controls
- [ ] **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest using attr_encrypted gem
- [ ] **Audit Trail System**: Build comprehensive audit logging for sensitive operations
- [ ] **Access Control Hardening**: Implement IP restrictions and rate limiting
- [ ] **Compliance and Documentation**: Create security policies and incident response procedures

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Completed API framework with authentication (Task 9) âœ…
- Existing user authentication and authorization system
- Background job processing system for security event handling
- Logging and monitoring infrastructure for security event integration

### External Dependencies
- Brakeman gem v5.4.1 for static security analysis
- attr_encrypted gem v3.1.0 for data encryption
- SSL/TLS certificate infrastructure and management
- Security scanning tools and vulnerability databases

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Security Posture
- Zero critical vulnerabilities identified in automated security scans
- 100% of sensitive operations covered by comprehensive audit trails
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and security header implementation at 100% coverage
- Password policy compliance rate >95% across all user accounts

### Compliance Readiness
- SOC 2 Type II compliance assessment readiness with passing scores
- GDPR compliance measures implemented with data protection controls
- Security incident response procedures tested and documented
- Regular security audit findings resolved within established SLA

### Operational Excellence
- Security scan integration adds <5 minutes to CI/CD pipeline
- Security incident response time <2 hours for critical issues
- Audit trail query performance <500ms for standard compliance reports
- Automated security monitoring reduces manual security tasks by 80%

# Task: Data Encryption at Rest Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive data encryption at rest using the attr_encrypted gem to protect sensitive user data, payment information, and other confidential data stored in the database. This ensures data protection even in the event of database compromise.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Install and configure attr_encrypted gem v3.1.0
- [ ] Identify and classify all sensitive data fields requiring encryption
- [ ] Implement encryption for personally identifiable information (PII)
- [ ] Encrypt payment-related data and financial information
- [ ] Set up secure encryption key management and rotation
- [ ] Configure database field encryption with proper key derivation
- [ ] Implement encrypted search capabilities for necessary fields
- [ ] Create data migration strategy for existing unencrypted data
- [ ] Add encryption status monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Document data classification and encryption policies

## Technical Details
- Use AES-256-GCM encryption algorithm for maximum security
- Implement key derivation using PBKDF2 with high iteration count
- Store encryption keys separately from application database
- Use environment-based key management for different deployment stages
- Configure automatic key rotation procedures with backward compatibility
- Implement encrypted field indexing where search is required
- Use database-level encryption for highly sensitive fields
- Add encryption performance monitoring and optimization

## Dependencies
- [ ] Authentication security hardening (Task 003) for secure key access
- [ ] Database schema analysis for sensitive field identification
- [ ] Key management infrastructure setup

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 18-20 hours
- Parallel: false (requires secure authentication foundation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] attr_encrypted properly configured and operational
- [ ] All sensitive data fields encrypted at rest
- [ ] Encryption key management system secure and documented
- [ ] Data migration completed without data loss
- [ ] Encrypted search functionality working where needed
- [ ] Encryption performance impact acceptable (<10% query slowdown)
- [ ] Key rotation procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Data classification policy documented and enforced
- [ ] Encryption health monitoring operational

# Task: Authentication Security Hardening

## Description
Implement strong password policies, enhanced access controls, and authentication security measures to protect against credential-based attacks and unauthorized access. This builds upon the foundational security headers to create a robust authentication system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement strong password policy with complexity requirements
- [ ] Add password breach checking against known compromised passwords
- [ ] Configure account lockout after failed login attempts
- [ ] Implement suspicious activity detection and alerting
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication (2FA) support for admin accounts
- [ ] Configure session security with proper timeout and rotation
- [ ] Implement secure password reset flow with time-limited tokens
- [ ] Add brute force protection with rate limiting
- [ ] Configure secure authentication cookies with proper flags
- [ ] Create admin account security audit functionality

## Technical Details
- Use HaveIBeenPwned API for password breach checking
- Implement progressive account lockout (increasing delay/duration)
- Add TOTP-based 2FA using rotp gem for admin accounts
- Configure session timeout based on user activity patterns
- Use secure random tokens for password reset with 1-hour expiration
- Implement IP-based rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Add device fingerprinting for suspicious login detection
- Configure authentication audit logging for compliance

## Dependencies
- [ ] Security headers implementation (Task 001) for secure cookies
- [ ] Automated security scanning (Task 002) for vulnerability detection
- [ ] Existing user authentication system
- [ ] Rate limiting infrastructure

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-18 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on foundational security measures)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Password policy enforced with complexity requirements
- [ ] Password breach checking integrated and functional
- [ ] Account lockout mechanisms working properly
- [ ] 2FA successfully implemented for admin accounts
- [ ] Session security measures properly configured
- [ ] Password reset flow secure and time-limited
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] Authentication security audit trail functional
- [ ] All authentication flows tested for security vulnerabilities

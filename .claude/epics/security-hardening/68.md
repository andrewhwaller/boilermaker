# Task: Comprehensive Audit Trail System

## Description
Build a comprehensive audit logging system that tracks all sensitive operations, user activities, and security events for compliance and forensic purposes. This system will provide complete visibility into system usage and support regulatory compliance requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design and implement audit trail database schema
- [ ] Create audit logging middleware for sensitive operations
- [ ] Implement user activity tracking and session logging
- [ ] Add security event logging (login attempts, permission changes)
- [ ] Create audit trail for data access and modifications
- [ ] Implement admin action logging with detailed context
- [ ] Build audit trail query and reporting interface
- [ ] Add real-time security event monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Configure audit log retention and archival policies
- [ ] Create compliance reporting capabilities

## Technical Details
- Use separate audit database/schema for data integrity
- Implement audit logging as Rails concern for reusability
- Track IP addresses, user agents, and session context
- Log data changes with before/after values for sensitive fields
- Use background job processing for audit log writes
- Implement audit log tampering protection with checksums
- Create indexed audit log structure for efficient querying
- Add audit trail search functionality with filtering capabilities

## Dependencies
- [ ] Data encryption implementation (Task 004) for audit log protection
- [ ] Background job processing system
- [ ] Database schema with proper indexing strategy

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XL
- Hours: 22-25 hours
- Parallel: false (requires data encryption foundation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Audit trail database schema implemented and optimized
- [ ] All sensitive operations properly audited
- [ ] User activity tracking comprehensive and accurate
- [ ] Security events logged in real-time
- [ ] Audit log query interface functional and performant
- [ ] Compliance reporting capabilities operational
- [ ] Audit log retention policies implemented
- [ ] Real-time security monitoring alerts working
- [ ] Audit trail integrity protection verified
- [ ] Performance impact on application <5%

# Task: Automated Security Scanning Integration

## Description
Integrate Brakeman static code analysis and bundle audit vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect security issues in code and dependencies. This creates a continuous security assessment system that prevents vulnerable code from reaching production.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Install and configure Brakeman gem for static code analysis
- [ ] Set up bundle audit for dependency vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Integrate both tools into CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Configure security scan failure conditions and thresholds
- [ ] Create security scan reporting and notification system
- [ ] Set up automated security scan scheduling for regular checks
- [ ] Implement security scan results dashboard/integration
- [ ] Configure ignore lists for accepted risks with documentation
- [ ] Test security scan integration with sample vulnerabilities
- [ ] Create security scan failure handling procedures

## Technical Details
- Use Brakeman v5.4.1 for Rails-specific security analysis
- Configure bundle audit to check for known vulnerabilities in gems
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated scanning on PR and push
- Create custom security scan configuration for project-specific needs
- Implement security scan caching to optimize CI/CD performance
- Configure Slack/email notifications for security scan failures
- Use security scan exit codes to fail builds on critical issues

## Dependencies
- [ ] Existing CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Access to vulnerability databases for bundle audit
- [ ] Notification system setup for security alerts

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 10-12 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside headers implementation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Brakeman and bundle audit fully integrated into CI/CD
- [ ] Security scans run automatically on all code changes
- [ ] Critical vulnerabilities prevent deployment
- [ ] Security scan results properly reported and accessible
- [ ] Team notifications configured for security issues
- [ ] Security scan performance optimized for development workflow
- [ ] Documentation for security scanning process created

# Task: Access Control Hardening and Rate Limiting

## Description
Implement advanced access control measures including IP restrictions, comprehensive rate limiting, and enhanced authorization controls to prevent abuse and unauthorized access. This creates multiple layers of protection against various attack vectors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement IP whitelisting for administrative functions
- [ ] Create role-based access control (RBAC) enhancements
- [ ] Add API rate limiting with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Implement geographic access restrictions where appropriate
- [ ] Create time-based access controls for sensitive operations
- [ ] Add device-based access controls and trust management
- [ ] Implement progressive rate limiting based on user behavior
- [ ] Create access control bypass detection and alerting
- [ ] Add emergency access procedures with proper audit trails
- [ ] Configure access control policy management interface

## Technical Details
- Use Redis-based rate limiting for distributed environments
- Implement sliding window rate limiting algorithm
- Add IP geolocation checking for geographic restrictions
- Use JWT tokens with device fingerprinting for device trust
- Configure rate limiting at multiple levels (IP, user, endpoint)
- Implement rate limiting bypass for trusted sources
- Add rate limiting metrics and monitoring dashboards
- Create access control rule engine for complex policies

## Dependencies
- [ ] Audit trail system (Task 005) for access control logging
- [ ] Redis infrastructure for rate limiting storage
- [ ] User role and permission system

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-18 hours
- Parallel: false (requires audit system for proper logging)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] IP whitelisting operational for admin functions
- [ ] Enhanced RBAC system properly implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse while allowing legitimate traffic
- [ ] Geographic restrictions configured where needed
- [ ] Device trust management working properly
- [ ] Progressive rate limiting responsive to user behavior
- [ ] Access control violations properly detected and alerted
- [ ] Emergency access procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Access control policy management interface functional
- [ ] Performance impact minimal on legitimate users

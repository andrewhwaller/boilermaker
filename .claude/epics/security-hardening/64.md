# Task: Security Headers and CSP Implementation

## Description
Implement comprehensive security headers and Content Security Policy (CSP) to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other web-based attacks. This foundational security layer will establish the first line of defense for the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Configure Content Security Policy with appropriate directives
- [ ] Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers
- [ ] Add X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- [ ] Configure X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME sniffing
- [ ] Set X-XSS-Protection header for legacy browser support
- [ ] Implement Referrer-Policy for privacy protection
- [ ] Add Permissions-Policy for feature control
- [ ] Configure secure cookie settings (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite)
- [ ] Test CSP compliance across all application pages
- [ ] Create CSP violation reporting endpoint

## Technical Details
- Use Rails secure_headers gem for standardized header management
- Implement CSP with strict-dynamic for script sources
- Configure nonce-based CSP for inline scripts and styles
- Set HSTS max-age to at least 1 year with includeSubDomains
- Use X-Frame-Options: DENY or SAMEORIGIN based on embedding needs
- Configure CSP reporting to monitor violations
- Test with CSP-enabled browsers and security scanning tools

## Dependencies
- [ ] Rails application with Phlex view components
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate properly configured
- [ ] Understanding of current inline script and style usage

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-15 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside scanning setup)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All security headers implemented and tested
- [ ] CSP policy covers all application resources
- [ ] No CSP violations on critical user flows
- [ ] Security header middleware properly configured
- [ ] CSP reporting endpoint functional
- [ ] Headers validated with security analysis tools
- [ ] Documentation for header configuration created

# Epic: Phlex Documentation

## Overview

Create comprehensive documentation for the existing Phlex view component architecture, providing developers with clear guidance on using, extending, and maintaining the component system. This documentation will serve as the foundation for future UI development and ensure consistent implementation patterns across the application.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Documentation Format**: Markdown files organized in a hierarchical structure within `docs/phlex/` directory
- **Code Examples**: Reference actual components from the codebase with working examples
- **Integration Approach**: Document current controller-to-component integration patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: Include component testing patterns using existing Rails test suite
- **Migration Guidance**: Provide ERB-to-Phlex conversion examples for remaining templates

## Technical Approach

### Documentation Structure
Create organized documentation hierarchy:
- Main documentation entry point with overview
- Architecture guide explaining component hierarchy and inheritance
- Controller integration patterns and best practices
- Component composition patterns with practical examples
- Comprehensive testing guide for view components
- Migration strategy for converting ERB templates

### Content Development Strategy
- Audit existing Phlex components to understand current patterns
- Create practical examples based on real components in the codebase
- Document controller integration methods currently in use
- Provide testing examples using the existing test framework
- Include migration examples showing ERB-to-Phlex conversions

### Reference Integration
- Link documentation to actual component files in the codebase
- Create cross-references between related documentation sections
- Include code snippets that can be copied and used immediately
- Reference Rails and Phlex official documentation appropriately

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
- Analyze existing Phlex components to understand current architecture
- Document patterns already established in the codebase
- Create practical, copy-paste examples for common use cases
- Focus on developer experience and ease of understanding

### Quality Assurance
- Ensure all code examples are tested and working
- Verify documentation accuracy against actual implementation
- Create clear navigation and table of contents
- Include proper syntax highlighting for code examples

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Documentation Structure Setup**: Create directory structure and main documentation files
- [ ] **Architecture Documentation**: Document component hierarchy, inheritance patterns, and organization
- [ ] **Controller Integration Guide**: Document how controllers interact with Phlex components
- [ ] **Component Pattern Examples**: Create examples for forms, tables, cards, modals, and navigation
- [ ] **Testing Documentation**: Document unit and integration testing approaches for components
- [ ] **Migration Guide**: Create ERB-to-Phlex conversion guide with before/after examples

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Access to existing Phlex component implementation (completed in Task 2.1-2.9)
- Understanding of current controller integration patterns
- Analysis of existing component composition patterns

### External Dependencies
- Phlex gem documentation for reference and best practices
- Rails view layer documentation for integration context

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Documentation Completeness
- All 6 core documentation sections complete and comprehensive
- Minimum 10 practical code examples with working implementations
- All major existing Phlex components referenced and documented
- Migration guide with at least 5 before/after ERB conversion examples

### Quality Standards
- Documentation passes development team technical review
- New developers can create their first Phlex component following the guide
- All code examples are syntactically correct and tested
- Clear navigation structure enables quick reference lookup

### Integration Success
- Documentation integrates seamlessly with existing codebase structure
- Examples reference actual components currently in use
- Migration guide helps convert any remaining ERB templates

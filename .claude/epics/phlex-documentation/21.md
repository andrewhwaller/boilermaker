# Task: Documentation Structure Setup

## Description
Create the foundational directory structure and main documentation files for Phlex component documentation. This includes setting up the docs/phlex/ directory hierarchy and creating placeholder files for all major documentation sections.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create docs/phlex/ directory structure 
- [ ] Create main README.md entry point with table of contents
- [ ] Create architecture.md file with basic structure
- [ ] Create controller-integration.md file with outline
- [ ] Create component-patterns.md file with section headers
- [ ] Create testing.md file with testing framework outline
- [ ] Create migration-guide.md file with conversion template structure
- [ ] All files have proper frontmatter and basic section headings

## Technical Details
- Use standard Markdown format with proper heading hierarchy
- Include cross-reference links between related documentation sections
- Create table of contents in main README.md linking to all subsections
- Follow existing documentation patterns in the codebase
- Set up proper file structure: docs/phlex/{README,architecture,controller-integration,component-patterns,testing,migration-guide}.md

## Dependencies
- [ ] Access to existing codebase structure
- [ ] Understanding of current Phlex implementation patterns

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (independent setup work)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete directory structure created
- [ ] All 6 documentation files exist with proper structure
- [ ] Main README.md has comprehensive table of contents
- [ ] Documentation follows consistent formatting standards
- [ ] Files are properly linked and cross-referenced

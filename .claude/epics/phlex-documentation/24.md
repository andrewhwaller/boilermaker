# Task: Component Pattern Examples

## Description
Create comprehensive examples of common Phlex component patterns including forms, tables, cards, modals, and navigation components. Document composition patterns, yielding strategies, and block patterns with practical, copy-paste examples.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document form component patterns with input helpers
- [ ] Show table component patterns with data handling
- [ ] Include card and content display component examples
- [ ] Document modal and overlay component patterns
- [ ] Show navigation and menu component implementations
- [ ] Include component composition and yielding examples
- [ ] Document block patterns and content passing
- [ ] Provide reusable component templates for common patterns

## Technical Details
- Extract patterns from existing components in app/views/components/
- Create working examples for each major component type
- Include component composition with parent-child relationships
- Show yielding and block content patterns
- Document slot-based content organization
- Include styling and CSS class management patterns

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 completed (architecture understanding)
- [ ] Access to existing component implementations
- [ ] Understanding of component composition patterns

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: true (can work after architecture is documented)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete component-patterns.md with comprehensive examples
- [ ] Working code examples for all major component types
- [ ] Component composition patterns clearly demonstrated
- [ ] Yielding and block patterns documented with examples
- [ ] All examples tested and verified to work
- [ ] Copy-paste ready code snippets provided

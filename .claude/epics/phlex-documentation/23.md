# Task: Controller Integration Guide

## Description
Document how controllers interact with Phlex components, including data passing patterns, rendering strategies, and best practices for controller-to-component integration. Provide practical examples based on existing controller implementations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document controller rendering patterns with Phlex components
- [ ] Show data passing from controllers to components
- [ ] Document component instantiation in controllers
- [ ] Include examples of complex data structures passed to components
- [ ] Document error handling and fallback strategies
- [ ] Show integration with Rails helpers and view context
- [ ] Include performance considerations for component rendering
- [ ] Document testing approaches for controller-component integration

## Technical Details
- Analyze existing controllers that render Phlex components
- Document render vs render_to_string usage patterns
- Show component instantiation with parameters
- Include examples from app/controllers/ directory
- Document integration with Rails view context and helpers
- Show error handling patterns for component rendering

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (documentation structure exists)
- [ ] Access to existing controllers using Phlex components
- [ ] Understanding of current controller integration patterns

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4-6 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside architecture documentation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete controller-integration.md with comprehensive integration guide
- [ ] Multiple practical examples from existing codebase
- [ ] Data passing patterns clearly documented
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases covered
- [ ] Performance considerations included
- [ ] Integration patterns tested and verified

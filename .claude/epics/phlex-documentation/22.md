# Task: Architecture Documentation

## Description
Document the comprehensive Phlex component hierarchy, inheritance patterns, and organizational structure. This includes analyzing existing components to understand the architecture and documenting patterns for future development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Document component hierarchy and inheritance patterns
- [ ] Explain layout components and their relationships
- [ ] Document component organization principles
- [ ] Include diagrams or visual representations of component structure
- [ ] Document naming conventions and file organization
- [ ] Provide examples of component inheritance in the codebase
- [ ] Document base component classes and their purposes
- [ ] Include component lifecycle and rendering patterns

## Technical Details
- Analyze app/views/components/ directory structure
- Document ApplicationComponent and other base classes
- Map component inheritance relationships
- Include actual code examples from existing components
- Document component registration and autoloading patterns
- Explain component vs partial usage decisions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (documentation structure exists)
- [ ] Access to existing Phlex components in app/views/components/
- [ ] Understanding of current component architecture

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false (requires completed structure from task 001)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete architecture.md file with comprehensive component hierarchy
- [ ] All major component patterns documented with examples
- [ ] Visual diagrams or representations included where helpful
- [ ] Inheritance patterns clearly explained
- [ ] Component organization principles documented
- [ ] Architecture documentation reviewed for accuracy against codebase

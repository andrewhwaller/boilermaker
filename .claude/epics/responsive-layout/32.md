# Task: Media Optimization

## Description
Implement responsive images and media for different screen sizes. This includes creating an optimized media delivery system that serves appropriate image sizes based on device capabilities, implements lazy loading, and provides fallbacks for various formats to ensure optimal performance and user experience across all devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Images scale appropriately using srcset and picture elements
- [ ] Different image sizes served based on screen density and viewport
- [ ] Lazy loading implemented for images below the fold
- [ ] Video content is responsive and maintains aspect ratios
- [ ] Image format optimization (WebP with fallbacks)
- [ ] Loading states and placeholders for media content
- [ ] Media queries optimize bandwidth usage on mobile connections

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create responsive media Phlex components with modern HTML picture elements and CSS for aspect ratio maintenance
- Key considerations:
  - Performance optimization for mobile networks
  - Progressive enhancement for modern image formats
  - Accessibility considerations for images (alt text, loading states)
  - SEO implications of lazy loading and responsive images
- Code locations/files affected:
  - Create responsive image Phlex components
  - Implement video wrapper components with responsive behavior
  - Add media optimization utilities and helpers
  - Update existing media usage throughout the application

## Dependencies
- [ ] Layout Framework (Issue #29) completed for consistent aspect ratios
- [ ] Asset pipeline configured for multiple image sizes
- [ ] Modern browser feature detection capabilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 14-18 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Responsive image components implemented with srcset/picture elements
- [ ] Lazy loading functional with intersection observer
- [ ] Video components maintain aspect ratios across devices
- [ ] Image optimization pipeline configured and tested
- [ ] Performance metrics show improved loading times
- [ ] Tests written for media component behavior
- [ ] Accessibility audit completed for media content

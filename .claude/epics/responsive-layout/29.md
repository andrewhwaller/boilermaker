# Task: Layout Framework

## Description
Create responsive grid system and layout components using Tailwind CSS. This involves building a comprehensive set of Phlex layout components that provide consistent responsive behavior across the application, including containers, grids, and flexible layout utilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Responsive container component with proper max-widths
- [ ] Grid system component with flexible column layouts
- [ ] Breakpoint-aware spacing and sizing utilities
- [ ] Layout components work seamlessly across all device sizes
- [ ] Consistent padding and margin patterns established
- [ ] Flexible layout patterns for different content types
- [ ] Layout components are reusable and composable

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create Phlex layout components leveraging Tailwind's responsive utilities
- Key considerations:
  - Mobile-first responsive design principles
  - Consistent spacing scale across breakpoints
  - Flexible grid system that adapts to content
  - Performance optimization for layout shifts
- Code locations/files affected:
  - Create new layout Phlex components (Container, Grid, Section, etc.)
  - Update existing views to use new layout system
  - Establish spacing and sizing constants

## Dependencies
- [ ] Tailwind CSS fully configured with custom breakpoints if needed
- [ ] Phlex component system established
- [ ] Design system tokens defined for spacing and sizing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-24 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Responsive container component implemented
- [ ] Grid system components created and tested
- [ ] Layout components documented with examples
- [ ] Existing views updated to use new layout system
- [ ] Tests written for layout behavior across breakpoints
- [ ] Performance testing completed (no layout shifts)
- [ ] Code reviewed for accessibility and semantic HTML

# Task: Content Display

## Description
Make tables, cards, and content responsive with appropriate breakpoints. This includes implementing responsive design patterns for data display components, ensuring content remains readable and usable across all screen sizes with proper overflow handling, stacking behaviors, and content prioritization.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tables scroll horizontally on mobile with sticky headers where appropriate
- [ ] Card layouts stack on mobile and grid on desktop with appropriate gaps
- [ ] Content blocks reflow properly at different breakpoints
- [ ] Long text content wraps appropriately without breaking layout
- [ ] Images and media within content scale responsively
- [ ] Data tables have mobile-friendly alternatives (card view, collapsible rows)
- [ ] Content hierarchy is maintained across all screen sizes

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Create responsive content display Phlex components using Tailwind responsive utilities and CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Key considerations:
  - Table responsiveness strategies (horizontal scroll vs. card transformation)
  - Content prioritization for mobile (show/hide less critical information)
  - Performance optimization for large data sets
  - Touch-friendly interaction patterns for mobile content
- Code locations/files affected:
  - Create responsive table Phlex components
  - Update card components with responsive grid layouts
  - Implement content block components with proper breakpoints
  - Add responsive utilities for content overflow handling

## Dependencies
- [ ] Layout Framework (Issue #29) completed for consistent grid system
- [ ] Tailwind CSS configured with appropriate breakpoints
- [ ] Base content components available for enhancement

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Responsive table components implemented with multiple display strategies
- [ ] Card layouts work seamlessly across all breakpoints
- [ ] Content overflow handled gracefully on mobile
- [ ] Performance tested with large data sets
- [ ] Tests written for content display behavior
- [ ] Accessibility audit completed for content readability
- [ ] Cross-device testing verified content usability

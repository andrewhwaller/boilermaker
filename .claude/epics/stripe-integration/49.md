## Description

Implement comprehensive test suite for all Stripe integrations using test mode and VCR for reliable, fast, and maintainable testing. Cover unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end payment flows with proper test data management.

## Requirements

- Set up Stripe test mode configuration and test data
- Implement VCR for consistent API response testing
- Create comprehensive unit tests for all Stripe services
- Build integration tests for payment and subscription flows
- Add webhook event testing with mock payloads
- Create performance tests for high-volume scenarios
- Implement test data factories and fixtures
- Build test utilities for common Stripe operations
- Add test coverage reporting and quality gates

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All Stripe services have comprehensive unit test coverage
- [ ] Integration tests cover complete payment and subscription flows
- [ ] Webhook processing is thoroughly tested with various event types
- [ ] VCR cassettes provide consistent and fast test execution
- [ ] Test data factories create realistic Stripe scenarios
- [ ] Performance tests validate system under expected load
- [ ] Test coverage meets or exceeds 90% for Stripe-related code
- [ ] Tests run quickly and reliably in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test utilities simplify writing new Stripe tests
- [ ] Error scenarios and edge cases are thoroughly tested

## Technical Notes

- Use Stripe test mode exclusively for automated testing
- Implement proper VCR configuration to avoid API rate limits
- Create realistic test scenarios including failure modes
- Add test helpers for common Stripe object creation
- Implement proper test isolation and cleanup
- Consider load testing for webhook endpoint performance
- Add security testing for payment flow vulnerabilities

## Dependencies

- stripe-001: Requires basic configuration for test setup
- stripe-002: Requires customer management for testing user flows
- stripe-003: Requires payment processing for payment flow tests
- stripe-004: Requires subscription functionality for subscription tests
- stripe-005: Requires webhook system for webhook testing

## Definition of Done

- Complete test coverage for all Stripe functionality
- Tests run reliably in development and CI environments
- Test suite provides confidence in payment processing reliability
- New Stripe features can be easily tested with existing utilities
- Performance testing validates system scalability
- Security testing confirms payment flow integrity

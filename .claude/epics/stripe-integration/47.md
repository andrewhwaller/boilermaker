## Description

Create comprehensive webhook processing system to handle Stripe events reliably. Implement event verification, processing, retry logic, and monitoring to ensure data consistency between Stripe and the application.

## Requirements

- Create webhook endpoint with proper signature verification
- Implement event processing service with handler pattern
- Build event retry and failure handling mechanisms
- Add webhook event logging and monitoring
- Create webhook event replay capabilities
- Implement idempotent event processing
- Build webhook health monitoring and alerting
- Add webhook event analytics and debugging tools
- Create webhook configuration management

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Webhook endpoint properly verifies Stripe signatures
- [ ] All critical Stripe events are processed correctly
- [ ] Event processing is idempotent and handles duplicates
- [ ] Failed webhook processing has proper retry logic
- [ ] Webhook events are logged for debugging and audit
- [ ] Event replay works for failed or missing events
- [ ] Webhook health monitoring alerts on failures
- [ ] Event processing performance meets requirements
- [ ] Webhook configuration is manageable and documented
- [ ] Event handlers are testable and maintainable

## Technical Notes

- Use background job processing for webhook events
- Implement proper event ordering for critical sequences
- Add webhook event versioning support
- Consider webhook event filtering to reduce noise
- Implement proper error handling and dead letter queues
- Add webhook event metrics for monitoring
- Use database transactions for event processing consistency

## Dependencies

- stripe-001: Requires basic Stripe configuration and webhook endpoint setup

## Definition of Done

- All webhook events are processed reliably and consistently
- Event processing failures are handled gracefully with alerts
- Webhook system can handle expected event volume
- Event replay capabilities work for data recovery
- Monitoring provides visibility into webhook health
- Event processing is fully testable and maintainable

## Description

Create Stripe Customer model and integrate with existing User authentication system. Establish the foundation for all payment and subscription operations by linking users to Stripe customers with proper data synchronization.

## Requirements

- Create StripeCustomer model with proper associations to User
- Implement automatic Stripe customer creation on user registration
- Build customer synchronization service for existing users
- Add customer update/deletion lifecycle management
- Implement customer data validation and error handling
- Create admin interface for customer management
- Set up customer search and filtering capabilities
- Add customer analytics and reporting basics

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] StripeCustomer model created with proper User association
- [ ] Automatic customer creation works on new user registration
- [ ] Existing users can be migrated to have Stripe customers
- [ ] Customer data stays synchronized between local DB and Stripe
- [ ] Proper error handling for Stripe API failures
- [ ] Customer lifecycle events (update/delete) are handled
- [ ] Admin can view and manage customer records
- [ ] Customer search works by name, email, and Stripe ID
- [ ] Basic analytics show customer creation trends
- [ ] All customer operations are properly logged

## Technical Notes

- Use UUID for local customer records to avoid enumeration
- Implement idempotent customer creation to handle race conditions
- Store minimal customer data locally, use Stripe as source of truth
- Add proper indexing for customer lookups
- Consider soft deletion for customer records
- Implement retry logic for failed Stripe API calls

## Dependencies

- stripe-001: Requires Stripe configuration to be complete

## Definition of Done

- All users can be associated with Stripe customers
- Customer data synchronization is robust and handles failures
- Admin tooling allows effective customer management
- Performance is acceptable for expected user volume
- All edge cases (API failures, network issues) are handled gracefully

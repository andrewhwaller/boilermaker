# Epic: Stripe Integration for Payments

## Overview

Implement comprehensive Stripe payment processing system enabling secure one-time payments and recurring subscriptions. The system will include customer management, webhook processing, billing portal integration, and complete test/production environment support for SaaS monetization.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Gem Integration**: Use stripe-rails gem v2.4.0 for Rails-native Stripe integration
- **Security Strategy**: Rails encrypted credentials for API key management, no payment data storage in application
- **Payment Flow**: Stripe Checkout Sessions for secure payment processing with redirect-based flow
- **Webhook Architecture**: Dedicated webhook controller with signature verification and idempotent processing
- **Customer Management**: Stripe Customer objects linked to User model for subscription and billing management

## Technical Approach

### Payment Processing Core
Implement secure payment infrastructure:
- Stripe API integration with proper credential management
- Customer creation and association with existing User model
- One-time payment processing through Stripe Checkout Sessions
- Payment success/failure handling with user feedback and email notifications

### Subscription Billing System
Build recurring subscription management:
- Stripe Billing/Subscriptions integration for recurring payments
- Subscription lifecycle management (create, update, cancel, reactivate)
- Prorated billing for plan changes and upgrades
- Trial period support and billing cycle management

### Webhook Processing
Implement robust event handling:
- Comprehensive webhook endpoint with signature verification
- Event processing for payment and subscription lifecycle events
- Idempotent webhook processing to handle duplicate events safely
- Error handling and retry logic for failed webhook processing

### Customer Self-Service
Integrate Stripe Customer Portal:
- Secure billing portal for customer subscription management
- Invoice history and payment method management
- Portal customization to match application branding
- Redirect handling and session management

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Foundation Setup**: Install stripe-rails gem and configure API credentials
2. **Customer Management**: Implement Stripe Customer model and User association
3. **Payment Processing**: Build one-time payment flows with Checkout Sessions
4. **Subscription System**: Implement recurring billing and subscription management
5. **Webhook Integration**: Build comprehensive webhook processing system
6. **Billing Portal**: Integrate customer self-service billing management
7. **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing with Stripe test mode

### Security Implementation
- PCI DSS compliance through Stripe's secure infrastructure
- No sensitive payment data stored in application database
- Webhook signature verification for all incoming events
- Secure credential management using Rails encrypted credentials

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:

## Success Criteria (Technical)

### Payment Processing Performance
- Payment processing completion time under 5 seconds average
- Successful payment completion rate >98% for valid payment methods
- Webhook processing completion within 10 seconds for all events
- Zero sensitive payment data stored insecurely in application database

### System Reliability
- Webhook processing success rate >99% with automatic retry for failures
- Idempotent webhook processing handling duplicate events safely
- Database transaction safety for all payment and subscription operations
- Graceful error handling when Stripe services are temporarily unavailable

### Integration Quality

## Description

Install and configure the Stripe Rails gem with secure API credential management. Set up the foundation for all Stripe integrations including environment-specific configurations and security best practices.

## Requirements

- Install stripe-rails gem and configure bundler
- Set up secure API key management using Rails credentials
- Configure Stripe webhooks endpoint secret
- Implement environment-specific configuration (development, test, production)
- Add Stripe initializer with proper error handling
- Set up logging for Stripe API interactions
- Configure CORS policies for Stripe-related endpoints
- Document configuration process and security considerations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Stripe gem installed and configured in Gemfile
- [ ] API keys securely stored in Rails credentials (not environment variables)
- [ ] Stripe initializer properly configures client with error handling
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations work correctly
- [ ] Webhook endpoint secret is properly configured
- [ ] Logging captures Stripe API interactions appropriately
- [ ] CORS configured for Stripe checkout redirects
- [ ] Configuration documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] All credentials follow security best practices (test vs live keys)

## Technical Notes

- Use Rails 7+ credentials system instead of dotenv for production security
- Implement graceful fallback if Stripe credentials are missing in development
- Set up separate webhook endpoints for different environments
- Consider rate limiting for Stripe API calls
- Ensure all API keys are properly masked in logs

## Dependencies

None - this is the foundation task for the entire epic.

## Definition of Done

- All Stripe configuration is complete and secure
- Environment-specific setup works across dev/test/prod
- Security review passed for credential management
- Documentation allows other developers to configure locally
- No hardcoded credentials anywhere in codebase

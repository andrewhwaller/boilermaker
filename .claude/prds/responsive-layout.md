# PRD: Responsive Layout and Navigation

## Executive Summary

Implement a comprehensive responsive layout system for the Boilermaker Rails application using Tailwind CSS utilities and Phlex components. This system will ensure the application works seamlessly across all device sizes, from mobile phones to desktop computers, providing an optimal user experience regardless of screen size.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
The current Boilermaker application layout is not optimized for different screen sizes. Users accessing the application on mobile devices, tablets, or varying desktop resolutions experience suboptimal layouts that may be difficult to use or visually unappealing.

**Why is this important now?**
- Mobile-first design is essential for modern web applications
- User experience across devices directly impacts adoption and retention
- This is a high-priority task (Task 3) that enables future UI enhancements
- Foundation must be solid before implementing features like dark mode and payment flows

## User Stories

**Primary User: Mobile App User**
- As a mobile user, I want the navigation to be easily accessible through a hamburger menu so I can navigate the app efficiently on small screens
- As a mobile user, I want forms to stack vertically and be thumb-friendly so I can complete actions easily
- As a mobile user, I want tables to be horizontally scrollable so I can view data without losing information
- As a mobile user, I want images and media to scale appropriately so they don't break the layout

**Secondary User: Desktop User**
- As a desktop user, I want a horizontal navigation bar that takes advantage of the available screen space
- As a desktop user, I want sidebar components for dashboard views so I can access multiple functions simultaneously
- As a desktop user, I want forms to use horizontal layouts where appropriate for faster data entry

**Tertiary User: Tablet User**
- As a tablet user, I want layouts that adapt to both portrait and landscape orientations
- As a tablet user, I want touch-friendly interface elements that work well with finger navigation

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Navigation Components**
- Mobile-first navigation menu with hamburger icon for small screens
- Desktop navigation bar that collapses appropriately on smaller screens
- Responsive sidebar component for dashboard layouts with collapsible functionality
- Navigation state management across different screen sizes

**Layout Systems**
- Responsive grid system using Tailwind CSS flexbox and grid utilities
- Responsive form layouts that stack on mobile and go horizontal on desktop
- Responsive tables with horizontal scroll on mobile devices
- Responsive footer with collapsible menu sections

**Visual Systems**
- Responsive spacing system using Tailwind utilities
- Responsive typography scale that works across devices
- Utility classes for hiding/showing content by screen size
- Optimized images and media for different screen sizes and resolutions

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- Page load times under 3 seconds on 3G mobile connections
- Smooth transitions and animations across all device sizes
- Optimized image loading and responsive images
- Minimal layout shift during responsive breakpoint transitions

**Compatibility**
- Support for all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- iOS Safari and Android Chrome compatibility
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

**Accessibility**
- Touch targets minimum 44px for mobile usability
- Keyboard navigation support across all responsive layouts
- Screen reader compatibility for navigation changes
- Color contrast compliance across all screen sizes

## Success Criteria

**User Experience Metrics**
- Navigation completion rate >95% on mobile devices
- Form completion rate matches or exceeds desktop rates on mobile
- No horizontal scrolling required on any target device size
- User task completion time similar across device types

**Technical Metrics**
- All layouts tested and functional on target breakpoints (mobile: 320px-768px, tablet: 768px-1024px, desktop: 1024px+)
- Lighthouse mobile score >90 for performance and usability
- All interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 touch target guidelines
- No layout overflow or breaking on target screen sizes

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints**
- Must use existing Tailwind CSS installation and configuration
- Must work within existing Phlex component architecture
- Cannot introduce new JavaScript frameworks (Stimulus controllers acceptable)
- Must maintain current Rails 8.0.2 compatibility

**Design Constraints**
- Must maintain existing brand identity and visual design
- Must work with current color scheme and typography
- Cannot require major restructuring of existing page layouts

**Timeline Constraints**
- Estimated effort: 1-2 weeks as noted in TASKS.md
- Must be completed before Task 4 (Dark Mode) implementation

**Assumptions**
- Tailwind CSS is properly configured with responsive breakpoints
- Existing Phlex components can be enhanced with responsive classes
- Current page layouts are structurally sound for responsive enhancement

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT included:**
- Complete visual redesign of the application
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Advanced animations or micro-interactions
- Mobile-specific native features (notifications, camera access)
- Responsive email templates
- Admin-specific responsive layouts (handled separately)

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies**
- Completed Tailwind CSS setup (Task 1) ✅
- Completed Phlex component library (Task 2) ✅
- Current navigation and layout components

**External Dependencies**
- Tailwind CSS responsive utilities and breakpoint system
- Browser support for CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Device testing capabilities or browser dev tools

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Responsive Breakpoints (Tailwind defaults)**
- `sm`: 640px and up (landscape phones, small tablets)
- `md`: 768px and up (tablets)
- `lg`: 1024px and up (laptops, desktops)
- `xl`: 1280px and up (large desktops)
- `2xl`: 1536px and up (larger desktops)

**Key Components to Make Responsive**
- Application layout and header
- Navigation menus and sidebars
- Form layouts and input groupings
- Data tables and list views
- Card layouts and content grids
- Footer and secondary navigation

**Testing Strategy**
- Jest and Testing Library for responsive behavior unit tests
- Visual regression tests using tools like Percy or Chromatic
- Manual testing on physical devices and browser dev tools
- Chrome DevTools device emulation for various screen sizes
- Cypress end-to-end tests for responsive user workflows

**Implementation Phases**
1. Navigation and header responsiveness
2. Form and input responsive layouts
3. Content and data display responsiveness
4. Footer and secondary navigation
5. Cross-browser testing and optimization

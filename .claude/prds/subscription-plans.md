# PRD: Subscription Plan Management

## Executive Summary

Implement a comprehensive subscription plan management system for the Boilermaker Rails application that enables tiered service offerings with feature-based access control. This system will integrate with Stripe billing, provide plan comparison interfaces, support plan changes with prorated billing, and include administrative tools for managing plans and features.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
SaaS applications require sophisticated plan management to offer different service tiers with varying feature sets and pricing. Without a robust plan management system, businesses cannot effectively monetize their applications, control feature access, or provide customers with upgrade/downgrade options.

**Why is this important now?**
- Enables tiered SaaS business models with different value propositions
- Provides foundation for feature-based access control throughout the application
- Essential for monetizing the Boilermaker template for SaaS use cases
- Integrates with completed Stripe payment processing to provide complete billing solution
- High-priority task that unlocks revenue potential

## User Stories

**Primary User: SaaS Customer**
- As a customer, I want to view available subscription plans so I can choose the tier that matches my needs
- As a customer, I want to upgrade or downgrade my plan so I can adjust my service level as needs change
- As a customer, I want to see exactly which features are included in each plan before making a decision
- As a customer, I want prorated billing when I change plans so I'm charged fairly for usage
- As a customer, I want to view my current plan and usage limits in my dashboard

**Secondary User: SaaS Business Owner**
- As a business owner, I want to create and modify subscription plans so I can adjust my service offerings
- As a business owner, I want to control which features are available to each plan tier
- As a business owner, I want to track plan usage and customer distribution across tiers
- As a business owner, I want to handle plan changes and billing automatically
- As a business owner, I want to set usage limits and overage policies for each plan

**Tertiary User: Admin/Support**
- As an admin, I want to manually adjust customer plans for support scenarios
- As an admin, I want to view customer plan history and billing information
- As an admin, I want to temporarily override feature access for troubleshooting

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Plan Management System**
- Plan model with configurable features, pricing, billing cycles, and usage limits
- Feature flagging system using flipper gem (version 0.28.1) for granular access control
- Plan comparison interface showing features, limits, and pricing for each tier
- Plan hierarchy with logical upgrade/downgrade paths

**Customer Plan Management**
- User dashboard showing current plan, included features, and usage statistics
- Plan change interface with immediate upgrade and scheduled downgrade options
- Prorated billing calculations for mid-cycle plan changes
- Plan renewal and expiration handling with grace periods

**Feature Access Control**
- Plan-based access control in controllers and views with role-based permissions
- Feature availability checking throughout the application
- Usage limit enforcement with configurable overage handling
- Feature access APIs for programmatic checking

**Administrative Interface**
- Admin interface for creating, editing, and managing subscription plans
- Customer plan management tools for support scenarios
- Plan analytics and reporting for business insights
- Feature flag management interface

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- Plan-based access checks must complete in <50ms
- Database queries optimized for plan and feature lookups
- Efficient caching of plan data and feature flags
- Minimal impact on application response times

**Scalability**
- System must support 100+ subscription plans
- Feature flag system must handle 1000+ feature flags efficiently
- Plan change processing must handle concurrent requests
- Usage tracking must scale with user base growth

**Reliability**
- Plan changes must be atomic with proper rollback capabilities
- Feature access must fail securely (deny by default)
- Usage limit enforcement must be accurate and consistent
- Billing integration must maintain data consistency with Stripe

## Success Criteria

**Business Metrics**
- Plan conversion rate from free to paid tiers >5%
- Plan upgrade rate among existing customers >10% monthly
- Accurate billing for all plan changes with <0.1% discrepancies
- Customer plan satisfaction >90% based on usage patterns

**Technical Metrics**
- Feature access checks perform within 50ms for 99% of requests
- Plan change success rate >99.5% with proper error handling
- Zero unauthorized feature access incidents
- Admin interface usable for plan management without technical support

**User Experience Metrics**
- Plan comparison page clear and informative for >90% of users
- Plan change process completion rate >85%
- Self-service plan management reduces support tickets by 70%
- Usage limit notifications prevent unexpected service interruptions

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints**
- Must use flipper gem version 0.28.1 for feature flagging
- Must integrate with existing Stripe payment processing (Task 5)
- Must work within existing Rails 8.0.2 and Phlex component architecture
- Must maintain existing User authentication and authorization patterns

**Business Constraints**
- Plan pricing must integrate with Stripe pricing tables
- Tax calculations must be handled through Stripe Tax integration
- Plan changes must comply with subscription billing best practices

**Integration Constraints**
- Must work with existing admin dashboard components
- Must integrate with existing user dashboard for plan display
- Cannot break existing feature functionality for current users

**Assumptions**
- Stripe integration is complete and functional (Task 5 dependency)
- Business has defined clear plan tiers and feature sets
- Feature flagging is acceptable approach for access control
- Users understand subscription billing concepts

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT included:**
- Complex usage-based billing (pay-per-use) beyond simple overages
- Multi-tenant plan management (different plans per tenant)
- Custom enterprise contract management
- Detailed usage analytics and reporting dashboard
- Integration with external CRM systems
- Automated plan recommendation algorithms
- Granular permission system beyond feature flags

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies**
- Completed Stripe integration (Task 5) for billing and payment processing
- Existing User authentication and authorization system
- Admin dashboard framework for plan management interface
- Phlex component library for UI components

**External Dependencies**
- Flipper gem for feature flag management
- Stripe API for pricing and subscription management
- Redis or database backend for flipper feature flag storage
- Background job processing for plan change handling

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Core Models**
```ruby
# Plan model with features and pricing
class Plan
  # Basic attributes: name, description, price, billing_cycle
  # Features: feature list, usage limits, access levels
  # Stripe integration: stripe_price_id, stripe_product_id
end

# User plan association
class UserPlan
  # Associations: user, plan, subscription
  # Status tracking: active, trial, expired, cancelled
  # Usage tracking: current usage, limits, overage policies
end
```

**Feature Flag Implementation**
```ruby
# Feature checking throughout app
class FeatureService
  def self.enabled?(feature, user)
    plan = user.current_plan
    Flipper.enabled?(feature, user) && plan&.includes_feature?(feature)
  end
end
```

**Key Components to Implement**
- Plan comparison page with feature matrix
- User dashboard plan section with usage meters
- Plan change workflow with confirmation and billing preview
- Admin interface for plan and feature management
- Service objects for plan changes and billing updates

**Implementation Phases**
1. Plan and feature flag models and database schema
2. Feature access control integration throughout application
3. Customer-facing plan comparison and selection interface
4. Plan change workflows with prorated billing
5. Administrative interface for plan management
6. Usage tracking and limit enforcement
7. Integration testing with Stripe billing system

**Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for Plan model and feature access logic
- Integration tests for plan change workflows and billing
- System tests for admin plan management interface
- Feature access control tests across application components
- Performance tests for plan-based queries and feature checks
- End-to-end tests for complete plan lifecycle scenarios

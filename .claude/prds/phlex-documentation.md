# PRD: Phlex Documentation

## Executive Summary

Create comprehensive documentation for the Phlex view component architecture that has been implemented in the Boilermaker Rails application template. This documentation will serve as the definitive guide for developers using Phlex components, covering architecture patterns, controller integration, testing strategies, and migration approaches from ERB templates.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
The Boilermaker application has successfully migrated from ERB templates to Phlex view components (Task 2 - 9/10 subtasks complete), but lacks comprehensive documentation. Without proper documentation, developers cannot effectively use, maintain, or extend the Phlex component system.

**Why is this important now?**
- Task 2.10 is the final remaining subtask of the UI Component Library task
- Documentation is critical for onboarding new developers
- Existing Phlex implementation needs to be properly documented before moving to responsive design work
- Future tasks (responsive layouts, dark mode) will build upon the Phlex foundation

## User Stories

**Primary User: Ruby on Rails Developer**
- As a Rails developer new to Phlex, I want comprehensive documentation so I can understand the architecture and start contributing effectively
- As a Rails developer familiar with ERB, I want migration guides so I can understand how to convert existing templates to Phlex components
- As a Rails developer working on new features, I want component composition examples so I can create maintainable view hierarchies

**Secondary User: Technical Lead**
- As a technical lead, I want architecture documentation so I can ensure consistent patterns across the team
- As a technical lead, I want testing documentation so the team follows proper testing practices for view components

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Documentation Sections**
- Comprehensive Phlex view architecture documentation explaining the component hierarchy and organization
- Controller integration patterns showing how controllers interact with Phlex components
- Common view component patterns with practical examples (forms, tables, cards, modals)
- Component composition guidelines including yielding and block patterns
- Testing guidelines for view components including unit and integration testing approaches
- Migration strategy documentation for converting ERB templates to Phlex components

**Documentation Format**
- Markdown format for easy maintenance and version control
- Code examples with syntax highlighting
- Clear section organization with table of contents
- Cross-references to relevant files in the codebase

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Accessibility**
- Documentation must be readable and well-organized
- Code examples must be properly formatted and commented
- Clear navigation structure for easy reference

**Maintainability**
- Documentation should be kept up-to-date with code changes
- Examples should reference actual components in the codebase
- Version control integration for tracking documentation changes

## Success Criteria

**Completion Metrics**
- All 6 documentation sections are complete and comprehensive
- Documentation includes at least 10 practical code examples
- All existing Phlex components are referenced in appropriate sections
- Migration guide includes before/after examples for common ERB patterns

**Quality Metrics**
- Documentation passes technical review by development team
- New developers can follow documentation to create their first Phlex component
- Migration guide successfully helps convert remaining ERB templates

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints**
- Documentation must reflect the current Phlex implementation in the codebase
- Examples must be based on actual working components
- Must be compatible with the existing Rails 8.0.2 and Phlex setup

**Timeline Constraints**
- Must be completed before starting Task 3 (Responsive Layout)
- Estimated effort: 1-2 days as noted in TASKS.md

**Assumptions**
- Phlex component architecture is stable and won't require major refactoring
- Existing Phlex components are well-implemented and can serve as examples
- Team has agreed on Phlex as the long-term view layer approach

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT included:**
- Training workshops or live sessions (documentation only)
- Video tutorials or multimedia content
- Advanced Phlex features not currently used in the codebase
- Performance optimization documentation (covered elsewhere)
- Deployment-specific configuration for Phlex

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies**
- Completed Phlex component implementation (Task 2.1-2.9) ✅
- Access to existing Phlex components in the codebase
- Understanding of current controller integration patterns

**External Dependencies**
- Phlex gem documentation for reference
- Rails documentation for controller integration patterns

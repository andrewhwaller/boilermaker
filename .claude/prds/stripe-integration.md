# PRD: Stripe Integration for Payments

## Executive Summary

Implement a comprehensive Stripe payment processing system for the Boilermaker Rails application, enabling both one-time payments and recurring subscriptions. This system will include secure payment handling, subscription management, webhook processing, and a customer billing portal, providing a complete monetization foundation for SaaS applications.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
The Boilermaker application currently has no payment processing capabilities, limiting its ability to serve as a foundation for monetized SaaS applications. Without integrated payment processing, developers cannot build subscription-based services or handle one-time payments.

**Why is this important now?**
- Payment processing is essential for SaaS business models
- Stripe is the industry standard for reliable payment processing
- This is a high-priority task that enables subscription plan management (Task 6)
- Early integration ensures security best practices are followed from the beginning
- Provides immediate value for developers building monetized applications

## User Stories

**Primary User: SaaS Customer**
- As a customer, I want to securely enter my payment information so I can purchase services with confidence
- As a customer, I want to complete purchases through Stripe Checkout so I have a familiar, trusted payment experience
- As a customer, I want to manage my subscriptions through a billing portal so I can update payment methods and view history
- As a customer, I want to receive clear confirmation of successful and failed payments

**Secondary User: SaaS Business Owner**
- As a business owner, I want to receive webhook notifications for all payment events so I can automate business processes
- As a business owner, I want detailed error logging for payment failures so I can troubleshoot issues quickly
- As a business owner, I want to test payment flows in development without real charges
- As a business owner, I want to track customer payment history and subscription status

**Tertiary User: Developer**
- As a developer, I want clear separation between test and production payment processing
- As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling so payment failures don't crash the application
- As a developer, I want to integrate additional Stripe features easily in the future

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Payment Processing**
- Install and configure stripe-rails gem (version 2.4.0) with proper Rails integration
- Secure API key management using Rails encrypted credentials
- Stripe Customer model creation and association with User model
- One-time payment processing through Stripe Checkout Sessions
- Payment success and failure handling with appropriate user feedback

**Subscription Management**
- Recurring subscription billing using Stripe Billing/Subscriptions
- Subscription model to store plan information, status, and billing cycles
- Subscription creation, modification, and cancellation workflows
- Prorated billing for subscription changes and upgrades
- Trial period support for subscription plans

**Webhook Processing**
- Comprehensive webhook handling for all critical Stripe events
- Webhook signature verification for security
- Event processing for: payment success, payment failure, subscription changes, customer updates
- Idempotent webhook processing to handle duplicate events
- Webhook retry logic and error handling

**Customer Billing Portal**
- Stripe Customer Portal integration for self-service billing management
- Customer access to invoice history, payment methods, and subscription details
- Secure redirect handling to and from Stripe portal
- Portal customization to match application branding

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Security**
- PCI DSS compliance through Stripe's secure payment processing
- No sensitive payment data stored in application database
- Secure webhook endpoint with signature verification
- API key protection using Rails credentials system
- HTTPS enforcement for all payment-related endpoints

**Reliability**
- Webhook processing with retry logic for failed events
- Comprehensive error handling and logging for payment failures
- Database transaction safety for payment and subscription updates
- Graceful degradation when Stripe services are unavailable

**Performance**
- Payment processing response times under 5 seconds
- Webhook processing completion within 10 seconds
- Efficient database queries for payment and subscription data
- Minimal impact on application performance

## Success Criteria

**Payment Processing Metrics**
- Successful payment completion rate >98%
- Payment processing time <5 seconds average
- Zero payment data stored insecurely in application database
- Webhook processing success rate >99%

**User Experience Metrics**
- Payment flow completion rate >90%
- Customer billing portal usage without support tickets
- Clear error messages for all payment failure scenarios
- Successful subscription management through billing portal

**Technical Metrics**
- All payment operations covered by comprehensive tests
- Zero PCI compliance violations
- Webhook signature verification 100% successful
- Test mode operations working without real charges

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints**
- Must use stripe-rails gem version 2.4.0 for Rails integration
- Must work within existing Rails 8.0.2 application architecture
- Must integrate with existing User authentication system
- Cannot store sensitive payment data in application database

**Business Constraints**
- Must support both test and production Stripe environments
- Must handle tax calculations through Stripe Tax (if required)
- Must comply with applicable financial regulations and PCI DSS

**Integration Constraints**
- Must work with existing Phlex component system for payment forms
- Must integrate with future subscription plan management system
- Cannot break existing application functionality

**Assumptions**
- Stripe account is properly configured with necessary permissions
- SSL/HTTPS is properly configured for secure payment processing
- Users have modern browsers supporting Stripe Elements
- Application will primarily serve customers in supported Stripe regions

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT included:**
- Multi-vendor marketplace payment processing
- Cryptocurrency payment options
- Manual invoice generation and management
- Advanced fraud detection beyond Stripe's built-in features
- Integration with accounting software (QuickBooks, etc.)
- Custom payment form UI (using Stripe Elements/Checkout)
- Payment analytics dashboard (using Stripe Dashboard)

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies**
- Existing User authentication and authorization system ✅
- Phlex component library (Task 2) ✅ for payment form integration
- Database models for user management
- Rails encrypted credentials configuration

**External Dependencies**
- Active Stripe account with API keys
- stripe-rails gem and its dependencies
- Stripe Elements for secure form handling
- Webhook endpoint accessibility from Stripe servers

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Stripe Configuration**
```ruby
# config/credentials.yml.enc
stripe:
  development:
    publishable_key: pk_test_...
    secret_key: sk_test_...
    webhook_secret: whsec_...
  production:
    publishable_key: pk_live_...
    secret_key: sk_live_...
    webhook_secret: whsec_...
```

**Key Models to Implement**
- `StripeCustomer` - Links User to Stripe Customer ID
- `Subscription` - Stores subscription details and status
- `PaymentMethod` - Stores payment method references
- `WebhookEvent` - Logs processed webhook events for idempotency

**Critical Stripe Events to Handle**
- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `payment_intent.payment_failed`
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- `invoice.payment_failed`

**Implementation Phases**
1. Stripe gem installation and configuration
2. Customer and payment method management
3. One-time payment processing with Checkout
4. Subscription billing implementation
5. Webhook processing and event handling
6. Customer billing portal integration
7. Comprehensive testing with test cards and scenarios

**Testing Strategy**
- RSpec unit tests for all Stripe-related models and services
- Integration tests using Stripe test mode and test cards
- VCR cassettes for recording/replaying Stripe API interactions
- Webhook testing with sample Stripe event payloads
- End-to-end tests for complete payment and subscription flows
- Load testing for webhook endpoint performance

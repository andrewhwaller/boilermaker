# PRD: Security Hardening and Compliance

## Executive Summary

Implement comprehensive security hardening and compliance measures for the Boilermaker Rails application to achieve enterprise-grade security standards. This system will include Content Security Policy implementation, automated security scanning, strong authentication policies, data encryption, audit trails, and incident response capabilities to protect against modern security threats and meet compliance requirements.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Modern web applications face sophisticated security threats and must meet increasingly strict compliance requirements. The current Boilermaker application lacks comprehensive security hardening measures, making it vulnerable to attacks and unsuitable for enterprises with strict security and compliance needs.

**Why is this important now?**
- Security breaches can result in catastrophic business and legal consequences
- Compliance requirements (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA) are becoming mandatory for B2B SaaS
- Enterprise customers require security certifications and audit trails
- Payment processing (Stripe integration) increases security requirements
- Early implementation is more cost-effective than retrofitting security

## User Stories

**Primary User: Enterprise Customer**
- As an enterprise customer, I want strong authentication and session management so my organization's data remains secure
- As an enterprise customer, I want audit trails for sensitive operations so I can meet compliance reporting requirements
- As an enterprise customer, I want data encryption at rest so confidential information is protected
- As an enterprise customer, I want IP restrictions for admin access so unauthorized locations cannot access sensitive functions

**Secondary User: Security Administrator**
- As a security admin, I want automated vulnerability scanning so I can proactively identify and fix security issues
- As a security admin, I want comprehensive security headers so the application is protected against common web attacks
- As a security admin, I want security incident response procedures so I can handle breaches effectively
- As a security admin, I want regular security reports so I can demonstrate compliance to auditors

**Tertiary User: Developer**
- As a developer, I want security scanning integrated into CI/CD so security issues are caught before production
- As a developer, I want clear security policies so I know what practices to follow
- As a developer, I want security tooling that doesn't impede development workflow

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Content Security Policy (CSP) and Security Headers**
- Comprehensive CSP headers preventing XSS and code injection attacks
- Security headers including HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
- CSP configuration compatible with existing JavaScript and CSS assets
- Header configuration testing and validation tools

**Automated Security Scanning**
- Regular security scans using Brakeman (version 5.4.1) for static code analysis
- Bundle audit integration for dependency vulnerability scanning
- Automated CI/CD integration for security scan reporting
- Security scan failure handling and notification system

**Authentication and Session Security**
- Strong password policies with complexity requirements and breach checking
- Account lockout mechanisms after failed authentication attempts
- Secure session management with automatic timeout and rotation
- Two-factor authentication support for admin accounts

**Network and Access Security**
- SSL/TLS configuration with HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers
- IP whitelisting for administrative interface access
- Rate limiting for API endpoints and authentication attempts
- Geographic access restrictions for sensitive operations

**Data Protection and Encryption**
- Data encryption at rest using attr_encrypted gem (version 3.1.0)
- Encryption key management and rotation procedures
- Personal data identification and protection measures
- Secure data deletion and retention policies

**Audit and Monitoring**
- Comprehensive audit trails for sensitive operations (user changes, payments, admin actions)
- Security event logging and monitoring
- Failed access attempt tracking and alerting
- Compliance reporting and audit trail export capabilities

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Security Standards Compliance**
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability protection
- SOC 2 Type II compliance readiness
- GDPR data protection compliance measures
- Industry-standard encryption and key management

**Performance Impact**
- Security measures must not increase response times by more than 10%
- Encryption operations must be optimized for performance
- Security scanning must not block development workflows
- Audit logging must not impact database performance significantly

**Monitoring and Alerting**
- Real-time security event detection and alerting
- Integration with existing logging and monitoring systems
- Security incident response automation where appropriate
- Regular security posture reporting and dashboards

## Success Criteria

**Security Metrics**
- Zero critical vulnerabilities identified in security scans
- 100% of sensitive operations covered by audit trails
- Password policy compliance rate >95% for all user accounts
- Security header implementation coverage at 100%

**Compliance Metrics**
- SOC 2 compliance readiness assessment passing score
- GDPR compliance assessment passing score
- Regular security audit findings resolved within SLA
- Incident response procedures tested and documented

**Operational Metrics**
- Security scan integration into CI/CD with <5 minute overhead
- Security incident response time <2 hours for critical issues
- Audit trail query performance <500ms for standard reports
- Security training completion rate >90% for development team

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints**
- Must work within existing Rails 8.0.2 application architecture
- Must integrate with existing authentication system and user management
- Must be compatible with Stripe payment processing security requirements
- Cannot break existing application functionality or user experience

**Compliance Constraints**
- Must support data residency requirements for international customers
- Must enable customer data export and deletion for GDPR compliance
- Must maintain audit trails for minimum required retention periods
- Must support customer security questionnaire requirements

**Resource Constraints**
- Implementation must not require additional full-time security personnel
- Must use automated tools to minimize ongoing manual security tasks
- Must integrate with existing development and deployment workflows

**Assumptions**
- Development team has basic security awareness and will follow established procedures
- Infrastructure supports SSL/TLS termination and proper certificate management
- Existing logging and monitoring systems can be extended for security events
- Business is committed to maintaining security practices long-term

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT included:**
- Advanced threat detection and AI-based security monitoring
- Custom penetration testing services (recommend third-party)
- Advanced identity provider integration (SAML, LDAP)
- Custom compliance framework development
- Physical security measures for infrastructure
- Advanced fraud detection beyond Stripe's built-in capabilities
- Bug bounty program management

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies**
- Completed API framework with authentication (Task 9) âœ…
- Existing user authentication and authorization system
- Logging and monitoring system implementation (Task 11 when completed)
- Database encryption key management infrastructure

**External Dependencies**

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Security Headers Configuration**
```ruby
# config/application.rb
config.force_ssl = true
config.ssl_options = { 
  hsts: { expires: 1.year, subdomains: true }
}

# Content Security Policy
config.content_security_policy do |policy|
  policy.default_src :self, :https
  policy.script_src :self, :unsafe_inline, :unsafe_eval, 'https:'
  # Additional CSP directives
end
```

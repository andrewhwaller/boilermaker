# PRD: Dark/Light Mode Functionality

## Executive Summary

Implement a comprehensive dark and light mode theming system for the Boilermaker Rails application. This system will automatically detect user system preferences, provide manual toggle controls, persist user choices, and ensure all components work seamlessly in both themes with smooth transitions and optimal accessibility.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Modern users expect applications to support their preferred color scheme, whether that's light mode for daytime use or dark mode for reduced eye strain in low-light environments. The current application only supports a single theme, limiting user comfort and accessibility.

**Why is this important now?**
- Dark mode is now a standard expectation for web applications
- Reduces eye strain and improves accessibility for users
- System-wide dark mode adoption continues to grow across all platforms
- Essential for providing a premium, modern user experience
- This is a high-priority task that enhances user experience significantly

## User Stories

**Primary User: Daily Application User**
- As a user, I want the application to automatically detect my system's color scheme preference so I don't have to manually configure it
- As a user, I want a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes so I can choose based on my current environment
- As a user, I want my theme preference to be remembered across sessions so I don't have to reset it every time
- As a user, I want smooth transitions when switching modes so the change feels polished and professional

**Secondary User: Accessibility-Focused User**
- As a user with visual sensitivities, I want dark mode to have appropriate contrast ratios so I can use the application comfortably
- As a user with light sensitivity, I want true dark backgrounds (not just gray) to minimize eye strain
- As a user relying on system accessibility settings, I want the application to respect my OS-level theme preferences

**Tertiary User: Power User**
- As a power user, I want keyboard shortcuts to quickly toggle between modes during long work sessions
- As a power user, I want the theme to apply to all application elements including third-party components

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Theme Detection and Management**
- Automatic detection of system color scheme preference using CSS `prefers-color-scheme` media query
- Manual theme toggle component accessible from main navigation
- Local storage persistence of user theme preference with localStorage
- System preference override capability when user makes manual selection

**Visual Theme Implementation**
- Comprehensive Tailwind CSS dark mode variant styling for all components
- Dark mode support for all existing UI components including forms, buttons, tables, cards
- Smooth CSS transitions between light and dark modes (300ms duration)
- Mode-specific favicon and application assets
- Dark mode variants for any third-party component integrations

**User Interface Controls**
- Theme toggle button/switch component with clear visual state indication
- Keyboard shortcut support (e.g., Ctrl+Shift+T) for quick theme switching
- Visual feedback during theme transitions
- Toggle component positioning in main navigation for easy access

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- Theme switching must occur within 300ms with smooth transitions
- No layout shift or flashing during theme changes
- Minimal impact on initial page load time
- Efficient CSS class toggling without page reloads

**Accessibility**
- WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast compliance for both light and dark themes
- Screen reader announcements for theme changes
- High contrast color selections for dark mode
- Support for users with `prefers-reduced-motion` settings

**Browser Compatibility**
- Support for all modern browsers with CSS custom properties
- Graceful fallback for browsers without `prefers-color-scheme` support
- Consistent behavior across different operating systems

## Success Criteria

**User Experience Metrics**
- Theme preference detection accuracy: 100% for supported browsers
- Theme persistence across sessions: 100% reliability
- User satisfaction with dark mode visual quality: >90% positive feedback
- Theme switching response time: <300ms average

**Technical Metrics**
- All UI components fully functional in both themes
- WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios maintained in both modes
- Zero visual bugs or inconsistencies in either theme
- Performance impact <5% on page load times
- Keyboard accessibility for theme switching functional

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints**
- Must use existing Tailwind CSS installation and dark mode configuration
- Must work within existing Phlex component architecture
- Must be compatible with current Rails 8.0.2 and Stimulus setup
- Cannot break existing styling or component functionality

**Design Constraints**
- Dark theme must maintain current brand identity with appropriate color adaptations
- Light theme remains the current default styling
- Must work with existing typography and spacing systems

**Browser Constraints**
- Must support modern browsers with CSS custom properties
- IE11 support not required but graceful degradation acceptable

**Assumptions**
- Tailwind CSS dark mode is properly configured
- Users have modern browsers supporting `prefers-color-scheme`
- Current component styling is sufficiently modular for dark mode variants

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT included:**
- Multiple theme options beyond light and dark (no custom themes)
- Automatic time-based theme switching
- Theme customization or user-defined color schemes
- Dark mode for email templates
- Advanced color palette generation tools
- Integration with external theme management systems

## Dependencies

**Internal Dependencies**
- Completed Tailwind CSS setup (Task 1) ✅
- Completed Phlex component library (Task 2) ✅
- Responsive layout implementation (Task 3) for proper theme application across devices

**External Dependencies**
- Tailwind CSS dark mode configuration and utilities
- Modern browser support for CSS custom properties and `prefers-color-scheme`
- localStorage support for theme persistence

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Tailwind CSS Dark Mode Configuration**
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class', // Enable class-based dark mode
  // ... existing configuration
}
```

**Theme Management Approach**
- Use `dark` class on HTML/body element for theme switching
- Stimulus controller for theme detection, persistence, and switching
- CSS custom properties for theme-specific color values
- Tailwind dark: variants for component styling

**Key Components Requiring Dark Mode**
- Navigation and header components
- Form elements and inputs
- Buttons and interactive elements
- Tables and data display components
- Cards and content containers
- Footer and secondary navigation
- Modal and overlay components

**Implementation Phases**
1. Tailwind dark mode configuration and base styles
2. System preference detection and localStorage persistence
3. Theme toggle component and keyboard shortcuts
4. Component-by-component dark mode styling
5. Third-party component dark mode integration
6. Cross-browser testing and accessibility validation

**Testing Strategy**
- Unit tests for theme detection and switching logic
- Integration tests for theme persistence across sessions
- Visual tests for both light and dark mode component rendering
- Accessibility tests for color contrast in both themes
- Cross-browser testing for system preference detection
- User testing for theme switching experience and visual quality

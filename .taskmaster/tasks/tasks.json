Rails 8 with tailwindcss-rails gem doesn't use JavaScript config files - it handles configuration through the CSS file and Rails-specific methods. The clean setup with just `@import \"tailwindcss\";` in app/assets/tailwind/application.css is the correct approach.\n\nInstead, customizations were implemented directly in the CSS file using Tailwind's @layer directive:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@layer base {\n  :root {\n    --rounded: 0;\n  }\n  \n  html {\n    @apply antialiased;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  /* Minimal color palette and spacing adjustments */\n  /* Dark/light mode support */\n}\n```\n\nThis approach aligns with Rails 8's integrated Tailwind support, eliminating the need for separate configuration files while maintaining the minimalist design requirements.\n</info added on 2025-06-27T15:48:32.930Z>",

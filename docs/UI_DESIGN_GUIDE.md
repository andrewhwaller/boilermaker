- **Secondary Background**: Dark gray panels for content areas
- **Table Row Alternation**: Subtle gray variations for readability

### Accent Colors
- **Primary Accent**: Bright green (`#00ff00`) - Used for active states, success indicators
- **Secondary Accent**: Orange/amber (`#ff8c00`) - Used for warnings, highlights
- **Tertiary Accent**: Blue (`#0080ff`) - Used for informational elements
- **Data Background**: Deep blue (`#003366`) - Used for data content areas in modules
- **Danger/Critical**: Red (`#ff4444`) - Used for errors, critical states

### Text Colors
- **Primary Text**: Bright white (`#ffffff`) - Headers, important data
- **Secondary Text**: Light gray (`#cccccc`) - Regular content
- **Muted Text**: Medium gray (`#888888`) - Labels, metadata

## Typography

### Font Characteristics
- **Font Family**: Monospace/Terminal font (appears to be a fixed-width font)
- **Style**: Clean, technical, highly legible
- **Sizing**: Multiple hierarchy levels with consistent scaling
- **Weight**: Primarily regular weight with occasional bold for emphasis

### Text Hierarchy
1. **Headers**: Larger, bright white text
2. **Data Values**: Medium size, high contrast
3. **Labels**: Smaller, muted text
4. **Status Indicators**: Color-coded text with background highlights

## Layout Structure

### Single-Screen Layout (table_design.jpg)
- **Multi-column layout** with distinct sections
- **Consistent spacing** between elements
- **Aligned data** in tabular format
- **Fixed-width columns** for data consistency

#### Key Sections Identified
1. **Monitoring Table** (left) - Task/project tracking with status indicators
2. **Main Metrics** (top center) - Key performance indicators
3. **Live Throughput** (top right) - Real-time data visualization
4. **Project Completion Rate** (far right) - Progress tracking with graph
5. **Design Visualization** (center) - Network/relationship diagram
6. **Master Control Panel** (bottom) - Action controls and status

### Modular Grid System (dashboard_design.jpg)
- **Perfect 4x4 grid layout** - 16 identical rectangular modules
- **Uniform module dimensions** - each card exactly the same size
- **Consistent spacing** - equal gaps between all modules horizontally and vertically
- **Scalable architecture** - grid can expand or contract based on content needs

#### Module Structure
- **Colored header bars** - green, orange, and blue variations for different module types
- **Alphanumeric labeling** - systematic naming (A1-PLANNER, A2-EXECUTOR, B1-VERIFIER, etc.)
- **Status indicators** - green and orange text elements in header areas
- **Blue data content areas** - consistent deep blue backgrounds for main content
- **Uniform information density** - each module contains similar amounts of information

## Interactive Elements

### Status Indicators
- **Color-coded backgrounds** for different states:
  - Green: Active/Success
  - Orange: Warning/In Progress  
  - Red: Error/Critical
  - Blue: Information/Pending

### Buttons and Controls
- **Rectangular button style** with color-coded backgrounds
- **Clear labeling** with high contrast text
- **Consistent sizing** across similar elements

## Data Visualization

### Tables
- **Alternating row colors** for readability

- **"EXPERIMENTAL INTERFACE"** subtitle in top-right
- Section headers like "MONITORING TABLE", "MAIN METRICS", "LIVE THROUGHPUT"
- Monospace font creates perfect column alignment in data tables
- Mixed case for headers, uppercase for labels like "AGENT", "TOTAL TOKENS"

**Specific UI Components:**

**Left Table Structure:**
- Row items like "E-5", "P-1", "E-6" with color-coded status backgrounds
- "ACTION ITEMS" and "CRITICAL TASKS" labels
- Status indicators: green backgrounds for active items, orange for warnings
- Time stamps and progress indicators (like "542 | 00:29")

**Top Metrics Bar:**
- "MAIN METRICS" section with specific values: "51,312", "$365"
- "LIVE THROUGHPUT" showing "1,921" and "$1.55"
- "PROJECT COMPLETION RATE" with percentage and trend line graph

**Center Visualization:**
- Network diagram with nodes labeled like "DESIGN", "ENG", "MARKETING"

- Scattered node positioning in circular/organic layout
- Color-coded nodes (green, red, yellow indicators)

**Bottom Control Panel:**
- "MASTER CONTROL PANEL" with progress bar
- Playback controls (play, pause buttons)
- Status message: "Good catch, but there is no immediate pressure to fire anyone. Instead"
- Time indicators and control buttons

**Specific Color Applications:**
- Bright green highlights on active table rows
- Orange/amber for "GLOBAL QUEUE" and warning states
- Red dots/indicators for critical items
- Blue accents for informational elements
- Subtle gray borders and separators throughout

**Layout Precision:**
- Perfect grid alignment despite varying content
- Consistent padding and margins
- Clean panel separations with subtle borders
- Strategic white space to prevent visual crowding

## Interface Style Descriptors

**What This Style Is Like:**

**"Command Center Aesthetic"** - Think NASA mission control, trading floors, or server monitoring dashboards. This is a **power user interface** designed for professionals who need to process large amounts of information quickly.

**"Terminal-Inspired Dark UI"** - Evokes command-line interfaces and hacker terminals but with modern polish. It's the aesthetic of someone who lives in code editors and monitoring tools.

**"Information Dense Dashboard"** - Every screen pixel is valuable real estate. No wasted space, no decorative elements - purely functional design where data is the star.

**"Status-First Design"** - Color coding isn't decoration, it's communication. Users can scan the interface and immediately understand system health through color patterns.

## Developer Instructions

**To build this style, tell your developer:**

### 1. Color System Implementation
```
"Create a strict color palette:
- Background: Pure black (#000000) to dark charcoal (#1a1a1a)
- Text: High contrast whites and grays
- Status colors: Green (#00ff41) = good, Orange (#ff8c00) = warning, Red (#ff4444) = critical
- Use these colors consistently across ALL status indicators"
```

### 2. Typography Rules
```
"Use a monospace font family like 'Fira Code' or 'Monaco':
- This ensures perfect data alignment in tables
- Create 3-4 text sizes max for hierarchy
- Headers should be bright white, data medium gray, labels muted gray
- NO fancy fonts - keep it technical and readable"
```

### 3. Layout Philosophy
```
"Think spreadsheet meets dashboard:
- Dense information layout but not cramped
- Everything in perfect grid alignment
- Consistent padding (maybe 8px, 16px, 24px system)
- Multiple content panels that don't compete for attention
- Tables should have alternating row colors for readability"
```

### 4. Interactive Elements
```
"Status-driven interactions:
- Hover states should be subtle (slight brightness increase)
- Active states get the green treatment
- Buttons should have colored backgrounds, not borders
- Everything clickable should be obvious but not loud"
```

### 5. Visual Hierarchy
```
"Information flows from general to specific:
- Top level: Key metrics and alerts
- Mid level: Status tables and real-time data
- Detail level: Individual items and controls
- Use color, size, and position to guide the eye"
```

### 6. Technical Considerations
```
"Build for data:
- Tables need to handle variable content lengths
- Real-time updates shouldn't cause layout shifts  
- Dark theme should work in bright environments
- High contrast ratios for accessibility
- Fast rendering - no fancy animations that slow down data updates"
```

### 7. Modular Grid Implementation
```
"For dashboard-style interfaces:
- Create identical rectangular module components
- Use CSS Grid for perfect 4x4 (or NxN) alignment
- Each module has: colored header bar + blue data content area
- Implement systematic naming (A1, A2, B1, B2, etc.)
- Ensure uniform spacing between all modules
- Make grid responsive but maintain module proportions
- Header colors should indicate module type or status"
```

**The Goal:** Create an interface that makes a user feel like a command center operator - powerful, informed, and in control of complex systems.

## Recommendations for Implementation

1. **Maintain high contrast** ratios for accessibility
2. **Use consistent color coding** across all status indicators  
3. **Implement responsive design** while preserving table readability
4. **Consider user customization** for color themes
5. **Ensure scalability** for different data volumes
6. **Test readability** across different screen sizes and resolutions

These designs effectively balance information density with visual clarity, creating professional monitoring interfaces suitable for technical users who need quick access to detailed system information. The patterns work for both single-screen dense dashboards and modular grid-based systems.
